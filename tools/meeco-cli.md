# Meeco SDK & CLI

We have created the [Meeco CLI](https://github.com/Meeco/cli) and SDK that allows you to interact with the Meeco APIs from the comfort of your command line. 

To get this up and running we have created tools that sets up a user for you, and creates all the necessary access tokens.

The Typescript CLI and SDK reside in the repository below

## Installation Instructions



To install the Meeco CLI you'll need to grab the latest version from the releases page [https://github.com/Meeco/js-sdk/releases](https://github.com/Meeco/js-sdk/releases) and grab the version with `releases/cli/`  followed by the version number you need.

We've created versions for Windows, Linux distributions and macOS.

Minimum requirements: 

`"node": ">=8.0.0"`

Unpack the folder, and then open a terminal window in that location. 

Type `npm link .` to allow you to use the `meeco` command, otherwise use `bin/.meeco`

You can now go back to the [Meeco Quickstart](../getting-started/quickstart.md) guide and follow the run-through in order to create a User, setup the Keystore, gain access to the Vault and create your first Item!
