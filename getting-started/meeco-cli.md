# Meeco CLI

We have created the [Meeco CLI](https://github.com/Meeco/cli) tool that allows you to interact with the different APIs for the comfort of your command line. To get this up and running we have created a tool that sets up a user for you, and creates all the necessary access tokens.

After you create a user, you can use the Dev Portal to make requests using your `vault_access_token` as the `Authorization: Bearer` header.
