# Setting Up

### Subscription Keys

Firstly, a developer must sign up at the [Meeco Developer Portal](http://dev.meeco.me/).

After following the signup procedure, confirming your account via an email and finally logging in, select "Get API Keys" from the home page.

Give your subscription a name, read through and agree to the Terms of Use, and subscribe.

This will generate the Primary and Secondary keys that are required to make requests in the developer portal.

The Primary key will be added to the `Meeco-Subscription-Key` header in all requests to the portal.

Once the subscription keys have been activated, you can begin to use them to make requests.

Now, jump into the [Quickstart section](quickstart.md) and follow along to create your first User and Vault item.
