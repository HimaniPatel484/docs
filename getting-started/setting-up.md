# Setting Up

### Subscription Keys

Firstly, a developer must sign up at the [Meeco Developer Portal](http://dev.meeco.me/).

After following the signup procedure, confirming your account via an email and finally logging in, select "Products" from the header bar.

Select a product, give your new subscription a name, then hit "Subscribe".

This will generate the Primary and Secondary keys that are required to make requests in the developer portal.

The Primary key will be added to the `Meeco-Subscription-Key` header in all requests to the portal.

Once the subscription keys have been activated, you can begin to use them to make requests.
